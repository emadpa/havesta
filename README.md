# havesta
Developed Havesta, a complete web application like Airbnb, with Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and MongoDB. The site 
provides users with the ability to register, post properties, and book stays. Created secure user authentication and 
session-based login for hosts and guests. Created and maintained MongoDB schemas to hold user information, 
listings of property, and bookings. Created dynamic, responsive pages with EJS for browsing and booking 
interfaces of property. Implemented RESTful APIs to manage property CRUD and combined booking logic with 
date validation in order to prevent conflicts. Leveraged Express middleware for declarative routing, error handling, 
and request processing, and a scalable property booking system was achieved
